# spotify-live
This is a responsive Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play and pause music, adjust the volume, and interact with a clean, user-friendly interface inspired by the original Spotify design. The project supports basic music player functionalities such as track switching, volume control, and live UI updates like song titles and album covers. Whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the layout adapts perfectly to all screen sizes. This project is great for learning how to build responsive media players using front-end web technologies.
